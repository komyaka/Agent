## 🧠 Agent Building Philosophy

### Core Principles

| Principle                       | Description                                                                     |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Specificity over Generality** | An agent that does ONE thing excellently beats one that does many things poorly |
| **Actionable Instructions**     | Every instruction should tell the agent exactly WHAT to do and HOW              |
| **Progressive Disclosure**      | Start with overview, then provide detailed steps                                |
| **Fail-Safe Design**            | Include constraints and stopping rules to prevent scope creep                   |
| **Tool Minimalism**             | Only include tools the agent actually needs (Principle of Least Privilege)      |

### The 3 Pillars of a Great Agent

## 🔍 Pre-Build Research Checklist

Before writing a single line of the agent, complete this research:

- [ ] Instructions are specific, not generic
- [ ] Workflow has clear, numbered steps
- [ ] Best practices are domain-specific, not obvious
- [ ] Anti-patterns explain WHY they're bad

### Technical Correctness

- [ ] Tools list is minimal (only what's needed)
- [ ] Handoffs point to valid agents
- [ ] Output format is well-defined

### Usability

- [ ] A developer can understand the agent in < 2 minutes
- [ ] Examples are realistic and helpful
- [ ] Constraints prevent misuse

---

## 🎯 Example Walkthrough: API Designer Agent

Let's apply the 7-step process to build `api-designer.agent.md`:

### Step 1: Define Identity

```
This agent helps you design RESTful and GraphQL APIs by applying
industry standards (OpenAPI, REST constraints) to create scalable,
well-documented API architectures.
```

### Step 2: Map Expertise

**Core Competencies:**

- REST architectural constraints (stateless, cacheable, layered)
- HTTP methods and status codes
- Resource naming conventions
- API versioning strategies
- Authentication/Authorization patterns
- Rate limiting and throttling
- GraphQL schema design
- OpenAPI/Swagger specification

**Best Practices:**

- Use nouns for resources, verbs for actions
- Consistent naming (plural resources: `/users` not `/user`)
- Proper status codes (201 for created, 204 for no content)
- HATEOAS for discoverability
- Pagination for collections
- Filtering, sorting, field selection

**Anti-Patterns:**

- Verbs in URLs (`/getUsers` → bad, `/users` → good)
- Inconsistent naming (mixing snake_case and camelCase)
- Exposing internal IDs
- Over-fetching/under-fetching
- Missing error schemas

### Step 3: Design Workflow

1. **Requirements Gathering**: What resources? What operations? Who are consumers?
2. **Resource Modeling**: Identify entities, relationships, hierarchies
3. **Endpoint Design**: Map CRUD operations, define paths
4. **Schema Definition**: Request/response bodies, error formats
5. **Security Design**: Auth methods, scopes, rate limits
6. **Documentation**: OpenAPI spec, examples, descriptions

### Step 4: Define Constraints

**MUST DO:**

- Always use consistent naming conventions
- Always include error response schemas
- Always version APIs appropriately

**MUST NOT:**

- Never expose sensitive internal data
- Never design without understanding consumers
- Never skip validation schemas

**HAND OFF WHEN:**

- Implementation is needed → `backend-developer`
- Security audit is needed → `security-auditor`
- Documentation writing is needed → `documentation-engineer`

### Step 5: Output Format

```yaml
# API Design Document

## Overview
- API Name:
- Version:
- Base URL:
- Authentication:

## Resources

### Resource: [Name]
- Description:
- Endpoints:
  - GET /resources - List all
  - POST /resources - Create new
  - GET /resources/{id} - Get one
  - PUT /resources/{id} - Update
  - DELETE /resources/{id} - Delete

## Schemas
[JSON Schema definitions]

## Error Handling
[Standard error format]
```

### Step 6: Select Tools

```yaml
tools:
  - search # Find existing API patterns in codebase
  - fetch # Research external API standards
  - githubRepo # Look at how popular APIs are designed
```

### Step 7: Write the Agent

> **Action**: Open [00-VSCode-Agent-Template.md](00-VSCode-Agent-Template.md), copy the template, and fill in the sections using the research above.
